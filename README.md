# Penetration Testing Execution Standard

## Project History

The Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) was originally developed as a comprehensive methodology to standardize penetration testing practices across the security industry. The project began as a community-driven effort to establish consistent approaches, techniques, and reporting standards for penetration testing engagements.

This modernized version represents an evolution of the original PTES framework, building upon years of community feedback and industry developments. The initial commit to this repository contains content from http://www.pentest-standard.org as of July 21, 2022, serving as the foundation for this updated iteration.

## Current Status: Draft for Comment

**This project is currently in draft status and is open for community review and feedback.**

We are actively seeking input from security professionals, penetration testers, and industry experts to help refine and improve the standard. Your contributions, suggestions, and critiques are valuable in ensuring this framework meets the evolving needs of the security community.

## About This Project

This project is an attempt to both modernize PTES and its supporting documents and improve the methods for the community to submit updates and additions. Our goals include:

- Updating methodologies to reflect current threat landscapes
- Incorporating modern tools and techniques
- Improving accessibility and usability of the documentation
- Establishing better community contribution processes
- Maintaining relevance with contemporary penetration testing practices
