# Penetration Testing Execution Standard - 2025 Edition

## Evolution of the Standard

The Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) was originally developed to provide a comprehensive methodology for conducting penetration tests. Since its inception, PTES has become a cornerstone resource, guiding security professionals in delivering consistent, high-quality penetration testing services.

In 2025, we find ourselves at a critical juncture in the penetration testing industry. We've made  progress from the days of "pentest puppy mills" where cookie-cutter assessments and automated scanning masqueraded as true penetration testing. However, with the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and automation technologies, we now face new challenges to maintaining the integrity and value of professional penetration testing services.  And the "puppy mills" still exist.

This updated edition of PTES acknowledges these challenges while reinforcing the core principles that make penetration testing an essential component of a robust security program.

## High Level Organization of the Standard

The penetration testing execution standard consists of seven (7) main sections. These cover everything related to a penetration test - from the initial communication and reasoning behind a penetration test, through the intelligence gathering and threat modeling phases where testers are working behind the scenes to get a better understanding of the tested organization, through vulnerability research, exploitation and post exploitation, where the technical security expertise of the testers come to play and combine with the business understanding of the engagement, and finally to the reporting, which captures the entire process, in a manner that makes sense to the customer and provides the most value to it.

The 2025 edition maintains this proven structure while enhancing each section to address emerging challenges and technologies:

1. **Pre-engagement Interactions** - Setting clear expectations and boundaries in an era of expanded attack surfaces
2. **Intelligence Gathering** - Balancing automated reconnaissance with human analysis and judgment
3. **Threat Modeling** - Incorporating modern threat actor techniques and motivations
4. **Vulnerability Analysis** - Distinguishing between machine-identified vulnerabilities and true business risks
5. **Exploitation** - Demonstrating realistic attack paths that automated tools might miss
6. **Post Exploitation** - Showing the true impact of security breaches in business terms
7. **Reporting** - Delivering actionable insights that transcend simple vulnerability listings

## AI and Automation: Challenges and Opportunities

The penetration testing industry has evolved significantly since PTES was first introduced. The rise of AI-powered tools and automation presents both opportunities and challenges for security professionals:

### Challenges

1. **Quality Erosion** - The increasing reliance on automated scanning and AI-generated reports risks reducing penetration testing to a commoditized service lacking human insight and contextual understanding.

2. **False Positives/Negatives** - Automated tools may generate significant noise through false positives or miss subtle vulnerabilities that require human intuition and creativity to identify.

3. **Unrealistic Expectations** - Marketing claims about AI capabilities may create unrealistic client expectations about what automated tools can actually accomplish.

4. **Skills Degradation** - Over-reliance on tools may lead to a reduction in core technical skills among security professionals.

### Opportunities

1. **Enhanced Efficiency** - When properly utilized, automation and AI can handle repetitive tasks, allowing human testers to focus on complex scenarios that require creativity and critical thinking.

2. **Expanded Coverage** - Automated preliminary scanning can help identify areas requiring deeper human investigation, potentially expanding the effective scope of testing.

3. **Advanced Analysis** - AI can assist in pattern recognition and correlation of findings across complex environments.

4. **Continuous Testing** - Automation enables more regular security assessments between comprehensive manual penetration tests.

## The Human Element: The Heart of Quality Penetration Testing

Despite technological advancements, the 2025 edition of PTES firmly maintains that high-quality penetration testing requires skilled human professionals who can:

1. **Understand Business Context** - Evaluate vulnerabilities within the specific business context of the target organization to determine true risk.

2. **Think Creatively** - Identify novel attack chains and scenarios that automated tools cannot conceive.

3. **Adapt to Defenses** - Respond dynamically to defensive measures and pivot accordingly, as real attackers would.

4. **Communicate Effectively** - Translate technical findings into business language that enables organizational decision-makers to take appropriate action.

5. **Exercise Judgment** - Make informed decisions about which vulnerabilities warrant investigation and exploitation based on the engagement's goals.

## Levels of Testing

The 2025 edition introduces a more refined approach to testing levels, acknowledging that different organizations have different needs and maturity levels:

1. **Baseline Assessment** - Largely automated scanning with basic human validation, appropriate for regular monitoring between comprehensive tests.

2. **Standard Penetration Test** - A balanced approach combining automated tools with manual testing, focusing on validating and exploiting vulnerabilities within a defined scope.

3. **Advanced Adversary Simulation** - In-depth manual testing with minimal reliance on automated tools, simulating sophisticated threat actor behaviors and techniques.

4. **Red Team Engagement** - Extended timeline, stealth-focused assessment that most closely mimics real-world adversaries, with an emphasis on avoiding detection while achieving specific objectives.

Each level requires progressively more human involvement and expertise, with clear guidance on when each is appropriate based on organizational risk profile, regulatory requirements, and security maturity.

## Technical Guidelines

The accompanying Technical Guidelines document provides detailed procedures and methodologies for executing each phase of the penetration test. This resource will be updated to reflect modern technologies, attack techniques, and defensive measures as the second phase in this project.

## Conclusion: The Future of Penetration Testing

As we look toward the future, the Penetration Testing Execution Standard remains committed to ensuring that penetration testing continues to provide genuine value in identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities. While embracing the appropriate use of technology, we maintain that true penetration testing is characterized by the skilled application of human creativity, judgment, and expertise.

By adhering to the principles outlined in this standard, practitioners can ensure their services are better than just vulnerability scanning to deliver the meaningful security insights organizations need to protect their assets in a complex threat landscape.

The distinction between automated security testing and professional penetration testing has never been more important, and this updated standard serves as a guide to maintaining the quality and value that define our profession.
