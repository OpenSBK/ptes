# Levels of Testing

The 2025 edition introduces a more refined approach to testing levels, acknowledging that different organizations have different needs and maturity levels:

1. **Baseline Assessment** - Largely automated scanning with basic human validation, appropriate for regular monitoring between comprehensive tests.

2. **Standard Penetration Test** - A balanced approach combining automated tools with manual testing, focusing on validating and exploiting vulnerabilities within a defined scope.

3. **Advanced Adversary Simulation** - In-depth manual testing with minimal reliance on automated tools, simulating sophisticated threat actor behaviors and techniques.

4. **Red Team Engagement** - Extended timeline, stealth-focused assessment that most closely mimics real-world adversaries, with an emphasis on avoiding detection while achieving specific objectives.

Each level requires progressively more human involvement and expertise, with clear guidance on when each is appropriate based on organizational risk profile, regulatory requirements, and security maturity.
